Game Design Project 2 Fall 2021

Code written by Jacob Bogner and Abe Sabeh

To run the multiplayer version of the game, run the server.py and client.py found in the /src directory
To run the original version of the game, run main.py in the main directory

This project will appear to have one-sided commits since we did a lot of this via pair-programming on Discord call.
Run server.py then client.py.
IMPORTANT: TO RUN CLIENT ON A SEPARATE MACHINE, change the variable server_address below to the local IP address running the server.
Sadly, this project is not working at the level we were hoping it would. Currently the client displays
local player movement as well as static sprites for other players connected to the server
Ordnance is added to the display by the server but remains motionless
Enemies continue to operate only on the local machine
